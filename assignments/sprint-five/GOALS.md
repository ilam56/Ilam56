## Current state: 
In its current state the app is just a simple google SSO example which displays extremely basic user information

## Future goal:
My goal it to create a basic survey app. This apps purpose is to allow the admin(me) to create various surveys which will be displayed on the webpage and will recieve user input and record the results. Thus the main purpose of the app is to record and display results of a basic survey from the users.

## Audiences:
There could be considered to be two target audiences
- Survey collectors: people who wish to create their own web survey to collect information. In general this will require some codeing experience as creating new surveys on the app will likely not be user friendly enough for those with no coding experience. Thus this audience will be those who wish to collect survey results and also have the ability to admin the software.
- Survey takers: these are the regular users who visit the site. This could refer to anyone and would vary greatly depending on the content of the survey. In general this group would refer to the people the survey collectors wish to collect data from as well as people interesting in the data.
