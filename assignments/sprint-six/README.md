I followed the example provided and created the basic example flask application. Information for how to create/run the app can be found here https://github.com/computationalmystic/MU-Software-Engineering/blob/master/assignments/13b.-team-sprint-5.md.

Note that to run the project need to set the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in your virtualenv each time. From there you just need to run the app.py usering command python app.py

The current project is incomplete as I have been having trouble getting the SQL to work properly. When complete the project will be a survey that uses SSO to keep track of results
