I used the flask example from class as a base and it is run the same way. To run the project you first need to set up a virtualenv. Once you have done that you need to set the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in your virtualenv each time you close the virtualenv. To figure out how to do that you can find direction here: https://github.com/computationalmystic/MU-Software-Engineering/blob/master/assignments/13b.-team-sprint-5.md. Once the virualenv is setup there you just need to run the app.py usering command python app.py.

The current project shows a minimal example of a survey app. It is working with SSO and SQL data storage. I would have liked to do more, but ran into too many problems which caused time constraints. Basically, you simply log in and fill out the survey. Once you submit, you will be take to a results page where you can see your results along with the total results of other users. I only had two google accounts so there are only 2 other survey results at the moment. If a single user wants to take the survey more than once he can, but his previous results will be overrided. This is ultimately just a minimal example and not really what I had hoped for. I do wish I could have done more, but I talked a bit more about that in GOALS.md
