I tried both the flask and dex app examples given in  the assignment. I had problems with the dex example. When running the make command I recieved an error (cc1.exe: sorry, unimplemented: 64-bit mode not compiled in) which resulted in not being able to run the app. I did try to debug if for a little while as well as consulted the teacher but in the end decided to give up in favor of the flask example. I had much better luck with the flask example and ran into few problems. I did have a little trouble filling out the google credentials from the google api. The instruction were not entirely clear, but I managed to figure it out fairly easily. I did consider going with a different SSO, but due to time constraints and recent health issues I deided to go with the simpler route. I did read through the documentaion provided at https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/#creating-your-own-web-application to try and get a little understanding of what was involved. By the end of the semester I hope to create a survey app that uses SSO. I would like to add in facebook or other SSO options as well, but that will depend on how things go. For more information about what the app will entail look as the GOALS.md documentation
