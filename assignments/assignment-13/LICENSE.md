# License choices
To be honest, I found it difficult to understand most of the licenses due to the legal language used and even after reading up on them from different sources I am not sure I understand them completely. That said from what I understand I think the type of license I would choose would depend on my goals. If the project I was working on was relatively small scale I think I would go with the MIT style license. This is because I wouldn't mind too much what it was used for and would be happy to have another entity come along and incorporate it into their product. If the scale of the project was rather large I would probably opt for something like the GNU general public license (GPL). If my understanding is correct, this would provide greater insurance that the project and its derivatives would remain open. In a larger scale project I would want to make sure that the work remained as open as possible to help insure the project integrated with the intended community as well as possible.
