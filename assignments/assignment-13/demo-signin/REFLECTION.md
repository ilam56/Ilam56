To start off with I tried to get started with openID. After searching for awhile I found a list of certified openid libraries. https://openid.net/developers/certified/. I started looking into the php version, but was unable to figure it out. I briefly looked into a few other options such as okta which was mention by another student. In the end I settled on sails which was demonstrated during class. I chose it because it was the one that seemed most straight forward to get started. I did get the basic demo app working, but was unable to figure out how to edit it. I tried going through the documentation as well as finding the a tutorial, but wasn't able to accomplish much. I talked to the teacher during office hours and he said I could worry about it in the next portion of the assignment. I also had a problem uploading the project to github. For some reason the node_modules folder doesn't get commited or pushed when I try to upload to github. I am not sure if this is because the folder is too large or if it is some other problem, but due to this I am not sure how to get the app to run off a git clone.
