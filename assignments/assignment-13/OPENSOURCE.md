# Reflection on opensource articles
Reading the articles did give some insight into some of the motivation of open source projects. I was a bit intrested to hear the portion about career motivation. I hadn't realized the potential of adding public github repositories to your resume and can see how that might be a decent motivator for at least some level of open source participation. I imagine that the top contributers of a given project probably have motivations that go beyond that though as such time investment usualy requires a suitable motivation. I wasn't suprised at all that fun was one of the top motivators. Fun is often a common reason for many of my own side projects, and open source projects give an outlet for many people with similar project ideas to collaborate. That said, I still feel finacial and practical motivation are likely required for the sustained health of a project. The examples of people being paid to work on a project or a company contributing to a project they themselve make use of are example of motivations that I would say are stable. A person can always become bored of a passion project, but unless a new competeing program comes out, a company which relies on an open source program will always have at least some motivation to contribute.
