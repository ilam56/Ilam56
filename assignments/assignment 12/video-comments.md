The first 20 minintes was setup as well as talking about changing the review metrics to combine 3 of the metrics together. They talked a bit about whether or not to make the change to combine the metrics as well as a little bit about the "wait period" before when the change should go through. After that they moved on to talking about inactive contributors metric. The first issue they had was to expand the metrics to check for all contributions not just commits. Orginally the metric counted a contributer inactive if they did not commit, but they requested it to count all contributions as activity. They then spent a few minutes talking about the formating. In particular they talked about whether "Aggregate" header should be a header or just bold text. They went into detail into a few minor errors such as spelling errors and grammar errors as well as shortening many of the sections. There was a period of confusion with the wording of the implementation section in which they decided to make some changes to the parameter names. They finalized some of their suggestions such as chaning the wording of objective section. The last part of the meeting they briefly went over a different meteric about code length.
